Design for the math operations to be implemented.

Vector datatype:
    - Should have operation overloading for:
        Dot product
        Addition
        Subtraction
        Scalar product
        Cross Product
        Output streaming
        Input streaming
Matrices:
    - Should have operation overloading for:
        Addition
        Subtraction
Trig:
    - Obviously should know normal trig functions and their inverses.
