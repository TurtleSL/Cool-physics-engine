# Cool-physics-engine
My attempt at a 2D game/physics engine. 

Compiled and built with CMake.

Credit to SDL3 for graphics(and possibly sound).

List of prerequisites inside of this folder.

Folder architecture will also be described in file-hierarchy.md.

I will have all my ideas of design for the following components of the engine:
    - Physics handling
    - The ECS (entity-component-system)
    - The rendering pipeline
    - The collisions engine

I have also provided a document on problems that I need to fix and handle later.

The .mds are not professional in any sort of way. They're more of quick jots as I go.
