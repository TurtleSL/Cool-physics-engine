# Cool-physics-engine
My attempt at a game/physics engine. 

List of prerequisites inside of this folder.

I will have all my ideas of design for the following components of the engine:
    - Physics handling
    - The ECS (entity-component-system)
    - The rendering pipeline
    - The collisions engine

I have also provided a document on problems that I need to fix and handle later.
